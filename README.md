* Spaced-repetition unit tests

* Java Neural Network Program

* Helper methods for communicating between iPhone and Rails

  Lets me do stuff like this:
  ```objc
  NSDictionary *catch = [Get dictionaryFromUrl:@"catches/%@", _catchId];
  ```

* Rails controller and model for the back end of an iPhone application

  * Controller uses decent_exposure to make it very clean
  * Model uses paperclip to store images on s3
  * ModelObject < ActiveRecord::Base uses metaprogramming to facilitate JSON serialization via ```include_attribute```

* Javascript for allowing the editing of a flashcard

  explain how to try this out...
